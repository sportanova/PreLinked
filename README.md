This was a project I worked on with a fiew friends over the course of two weeks. My main responsibilities were LinkedIn login with oAuth, the jobs search filter, and unit testing critical parts of the app.

### Don't Be Just Another Resume. Get PreLinked

Finding a job is tough, and can make you feel like just another piece of paper in a sea of resumes. 
Knowing someone at a company dramatically increase your chances of getting an interview, but until Prelinked, figuring
out what companies were hiring AND finding the decision makers could be a daunting task.
